# Introduction to Deep Learning with PyTorch Study Notes

This is a repository of my listicle style study notes that takes the most important concepts from the Udacity Bertelsmann 2019 AI challenge course - Introduction to Deep Learning with PyTorch. I've taken the minimalist approach by listing the important concepts and if needed a reference to a good and clear article that explains the concepts. The ultimate purpose of this doc is to break down complex deep learning concepts into simple digestable pieces.
